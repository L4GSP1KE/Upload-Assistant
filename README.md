# L4G's Upload Assistant

A simple tool to take the work out of uploading.

## What It Can Do:
  - Generates and Parses MediaInfo/BDInfo.
  - Generates and Uploads screenshots.
  - Uses srrdb to fix scene filenames
  - Can grab descriptions from PTP (automatically on filename match or arg) / BLU (arg)
  - Obtains TMDb/IMDb/MAL identifiers.
  - Converts absolute to season episode numbering for Anime
  - Generates custom .torrents without useless top level folders/nfos.
  - Can re-use existing torrents instead of hashing new
  - Generates proper name for your upload using Mediainfo/BDInfo and TMDb/IMDb conforming to site rules
  - Checks for existing releases already on site
  - Uploads to PTP/BLU/BHD/Aither/THR/STC/R4E(limited)/STT/HP/ACM/LCD/LST/NBL/ANT/FL/HUNO/RF/SN/ULCX
  - Adds to your client with fast resume, seeding instantly (rtorrent/qbittorrent/deluge/watch folder)
  - ALL WITH MINIMAL INPUT!
  - Currently works with .mkv/.mp4/Blu-ray/DVD/HD-DVDs
